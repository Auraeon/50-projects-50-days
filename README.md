# 50-projects-50-days
My first 50 front end design and development projects in 50 days

I'm taking on the challenge of completing 50 or more frontend development projects via tutorials located around the web, within 50 days.
I will likely do more than 1 project per day but also not do any some days, but my end goal is 50 projects completed within 50 days.

If I'm successful, I will do 100 projects in 100 days as my next challenge for myself.

Thanks for tagging along for the journey!
